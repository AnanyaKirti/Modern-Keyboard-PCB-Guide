# Keyboard PCB Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

## Introduction <!-- omit in toc -->

Frustrated from the lack of documentation available on the internet, I decided to make my own keyboard PCB making guide with updated resources. Aside from the main tutorial aimed for people who are starting out, there will also be guides on other parts or components of a keyboard PCB such as USB-C, TRRS conectors, backlighting, RGB, etc.
