# STM32 Keyboard PCB Guide <!-- omit in toc --> 

Now that there are a few boards powered by STM32 microcontrollers, it's about time we have an updated PCB guide aimed for STM32 chips. This guide will cover PCB design to PCB manufacturing and finally flashing of firmware.

## PCB Design

### Installation and Setup

Before anything else, you'll need to have [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/) up and running on your computer/laptop.

You'll also want to download some component and footprint libraries. To make things more streamlined, I have included all libraries you'll need for this guide right here.



**Note:** You'll want to use mouse with a clickable scroll wheel for KiCAD so that navigation will be easier.
